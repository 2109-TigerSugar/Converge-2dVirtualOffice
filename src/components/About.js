            <h3> Map with varying work environments</h3>

            <p>
              Each space allows you to signal to coworkers your availability.

            <h3> Remote work, without the cons</h3>

            <p>
              Being able to work remotely, while still having natural and casual
              interactions is a major benefit of Converge. Plus no traffic!

            <h3> Be inspired, not burnt out</h3>
            <p>
              Screen fatigue is real. Interacting on converge reduces this by
              offering engaging graphics. No more boring square boxes.

            <h3> Make virtual interactions more human</h3>
            <p>
              Video chat shouldnâ€™t be awkward. Walking in and out of
              conversations feels natural and seamless.

            <h3> So... exactly what is proximity video chat?</h3>
            <p>
              Calls are only trigged if you are close enough to another
              coworker's avatar.

            <h3> I just walk up to them?</h3>
            <p>
              YES! It's that easy. Just like in real life. When y ou want to end
              the call, simply walk away.

            <h3> Your proximity circle </h3>
            <p>
              You are able to show and hide your proximity circle as you work.
              It is nice to use in the beginning to get the hang of the distance
              needed to talk to someone.

            <h3> Custom proximity circle</h3>

            <p>
              Why of course we allow you to express yourself at Converge, even
              with the proximity circle. Choose your color on the login screen.
